# IE.Recaptcha

A project made by students of [IE NITK](https://ie.nitk.ac.in/). Two CNNs are implemented in this model, one of them solves CAPTCHAs generated by Python's ImageCaptcha Library and the other model solves CAPTCHAs generated by JAVA's SimpleCaptcha Captcha Library.

#### Custom CNN Architecture Performance

- The Model was trained on SimpleCaptcha Generated text-based CAPTCHAs

- The following plots were obtained : -
